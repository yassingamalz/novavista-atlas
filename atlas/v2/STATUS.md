## 📊 Training Configuration

### Original Sportlight Config:
```yaml
batch_size: 8
input_size: [960, 540]  # Half HD
GPU: 24GB VRAM
workers: 8
```

### Modified Colab Config:
```yaml
batch_size: 4           # Fits in 16GB
input_size: [720, 405]  # Reduced resolution
GPU: 16GB VRAM (T4)
workers: 2
amp: true               # Mixed precision
```

**Expected Results:**
- Training time: 6-10 hours on T4
- Model size: ~200-300 MB
- Accuracy: 70-75% (slightly lower due to reduced resolution)

## 🎓 Training Resources

### Dataset:
- **Source:** SoccerNet Camera Calibration Challenge
- **Size:** ~5-10 GB (train + valid)
- **Format:** `.jpg` images + `.json` annotations
- **Download:** https://github.com/SoccerNet/sn-calibration

### Colab Requirements:
- **GPU:** T4 (16GB) - Available on free tier
- **Runtime:** 12 hours max (free) or 24 hours (Colab Pro)
- **Storage:** Google Drive for dataset & models

### Notebook Features:
- ✅ Automatic environment setup
- ✅ Dataset verification
- ✅ Config modification for Colab
- ✅ Training monitoring
- ✅ Model download to Drive

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Out of Memory:
```yaml
# Further reduce in notebook
batch_size: 2
input_size: [640, 360]
```

### Session Timeout:
- Use Colab Pro ($10/month) for 24h sessions
- Resume from checkpoints (saved every 2 epochs)
- Train in multiple sessions

### Dataset Issues:
- Verify JSON format (see notebook)
- Check image-JSON pairing
- Ensure correct directory structure

---

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### SoccerNet Benchmark:
- Sportlight (original): 73.22% accuracy, 75.59% completeness
- Our Colab version: ~70-75% accuracy (reduced resolution)

### Egyptian League Target:
- Completeness: >75% (acceptable)
- Accuracy: >70% (validated visually)
- Speed: <200ms per frame

### If Results < 75%:
- Activate Phase 4: Hybrid with Spiideo (99.96% completeness)
- Fine-tune on Egyptian League footage
- Add preprocessing filters

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Training:
1. **Use Colab Pro** if training takes > 12 hours
2. **Save checkpoints to Drive** frequently
3. **Monitor GPU memory** during training
4. **Test on small dataset first** to verify setup

### For Dataset:
1. **Verify all JSONs** before uploading
2. **Check image-JSON pairing** is correct
3. **Use .tar.gz** for faster upload to Drive
4. **Keep dataset organized** for easy access

### For Integration:
1. **Wait for training to complete** before Phase 3
2. **Test model standalone** before integration
3. **Validate on diverse frames** (day/night, angles)
4. **Keep git history clean** with logical commits
