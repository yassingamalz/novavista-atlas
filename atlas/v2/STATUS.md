# Atlas v2 Implementation Status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Finding: Sportlight Requires Training

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete
- Sportlight repository cloned as submodule
- Repository structure analyzed
- Requirements documented

### üö® **Major Issue: No Pre-trained Models Available**

**Finding:**
- GitHub repository contains **training code only**
- No pre-trained `.pth` model files included
- No releases with downloadable weights
- Must train from scratch

**Training Requirements:**
- Linux OS (tested on OpenSUSE 15.5, Ubuntu 22.04)
- NVIDIA GPU with **24GB+ VRAM** (RTX 3090/4090)
- Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- SoccerNet dataset (download separately)
- Training time: Unknown (likely hours/days)

**Current Environment:**
- OS: Windows
- GPU: Unknown specs
- Docker: May not be configured
- SoccerNet dataset: Not downloaded

## üîÑ **Decision Point: Change Approach**

### Problem
Sportlight requires significant setup that may not be feasible:
1. Linux environment (WSL2 possible but complex)
2. 24GB+ GPU requirement
3. Full model training pipeline
4. SoccerNet dataset download and preparation
5. Days of training time

### Recommended Solution Switch

**Option 1: Use NBJW Instead** ‚≠ê (RECOMMENDED)
- Repository: https://github.com/mguti97/No-Bells-Just-Whistles
- Claims: 95%+ accuracy (vs Sportlight 73.22%)
- Status: Check if pre-trained models available
- License: Verify MIT/commercial use
- Platform: Check Windows compatibility

**Option 2: Simplified Approach**
- Use traditional CV methods (classical field detection)
- Lower accuracy but immediate deployment
- No training required
- Windows-compatible

**Option 3: Continue with Sportlight**
- Set up WSL2 + Docker
- Verify GPU specs
- Download SoccerNet dataset
- Train models from scratch (multi-day process)

## üìä Comparison

| Solution | Accuracy | Pre-trained | Windows | Setup Time | Training Required |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Sportlight** | 73.22% | ‚ùå NO | ‚ùå Linux | Days | ‚úÖ YES |
| **NBJW** | 95%+ claimed | ‚ùì Unknown | ‚ùì Check | Hours? | ‚ùì Check |
| **Classical CV** | 60-70% | N/A | ‚úÖ YES | Minutes | ‚ùå NO |

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check NBJW repository** for pre-trained models
2. **Verify NBJW Windows compatibility**
3. **If NBJW unavailable**: Decide between:
   - Set up Linux environment for Sportlight training
   - Fall back to classical CV approach
   - Look for alternative pre-trained solutions

---

**Status:** Phase 1 complete - Need decision on approach
**Blocker:** No pre-trained Sportlight models, training infeasible on Windows
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Action:** Evaluate NBJW as primary alternative
